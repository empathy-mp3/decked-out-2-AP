# Decked Out 2 Manual Randomizer Guide

## What is Decked Out 2, anyway?

It's a Roguelike built entirely in survival minecraft. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/aoVVCwx6k1w) to learn more.

## Where is the settings page?

The .yaml file is included with the GitHub release.

## What does randomization do to this game?

There are cards that help you stay alive in the dungeon for longer, and these are randomized. There are 6 locations corresponding to each card in the Frost Ember shop at the end of each run, and 6 locations corresponding to everything you can buy at the Crown Shop in the foyer. Once you buy something, check off all 6 corresponding locations, and throw away whatever it was you purchased.

If you obtain an item, go into the Master Dungeon Locker on the far back of the foyer, and what you do with it depends on what it is:
- If it is a Non-Ethereal card, you can put it into your deck before you start a run, but make sure there's only 40 cards in your deck at maximum. You can use the helpful Card Counter to make sure it's within limits! You can store the unused ones in your Ender Chest (though please throw out the cards that start in your ender chest).
- If it is an Ethereal card, but *not* a Stumble card, you can put it into your deck when you please, but it will be consumed on use, so plan when you use them!
- If it is a Stumble (a trap), you *must* put it into your deck in your next run, and if you already have 40 cards, some of them will have to be temporarily removed. Just, please still try in spite of having a very clear temporary disadvantage
- If it is a Key, you can enter the dungeon with it in your inventory, but like Ethereal cards, they will be consumed, so use them wisely.

## Some random notes

- Get rid of everything that's in your ender chest by default.
- The pancake that spawns at the start of each run is for making sure you're topped off on food at the start of the run, not for bringing into the dungeon. If you're full on hunger, ignore it.
- The game doesn't start if you have an empty deck, and breaks if you have a deck with only Ethereal cards. If you have no cards, put a Sneak into your deck, temporarily, until you get any non-Ethereal cards. It should happen relatively quickly, unless you're playing in a really cursed async.
- I recommend that you use 50% filler items replaced by traps (or more). There's a lot of very useful items not accounted for in logic because they're Ethereal.

## What is the goal of a Manual game when randomized?

The goal is to make it down to **The Burning Dark** (Level 4), obtain **The Bomb** that spawns in the towers around the level, and bring it to the giant gateway, and put it in the barrel, go in, and push the button to open **The Hideout**, and, in the same run, you need to have obtained a **The Master's Key** artifact from Level 4 (Deepfrost difficulty). Once you've done both of those things, go to the flat structure nearby the gateway, and quickly run through the gap in the side of it (across the pressuren plate), while burning on the magma blocks. There should be a hole to fall down (if there's too small a gap to fit through, you weren't fast enough), and from there you put the master's key into the barrel, and proceed into the hideout. Once you've done that, you've won!

It's a really hard goal, and I might add more difficult goals in the future.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Cards and Keys.

## how do i get legendary card locations?

- firstly, you need to find the "warden's office" on either level 3 and pick up a key there. there's a black market near the boat that requires some parkour to get to, and you can use the key to open it up.
- you'll be able to acquire templates for the legendary cards, which you can use, along with the 3 ingredients they list, at the forge in the back of the frost ember shop (which can be opened up for 40 embers).

the methods to obtain those ingredients are as follows:

- melon: hidden button on boat
- glow ink sac: lake/flooded depths (you're allowed to kill glow squids)
- tropical fish: lake/flooded depths (you're allowed to kill tropical fish)
- basalt: burning dark entrance (from black mines)
- spider eye: spider cave (in caves of carnage) (you're allowed to kill them)
- sugar: caves of carnage. button on the back of the axolotl pond
- slimeball: black mines (you're allowed to kill them)
- sweet berry: anywhere
- cactus: use a trapdoor to crouch into a secret area in pearl's desert room in caves of carnage. there's a button
- egg: rusty room (caves of carnage). you have to do parkour
- bone meal: to my knowledge, you just use berries on the composters on the boat. lmk if you find more "legal" ways of doing it
- twisted vine: burning dark. there's a button in a very secluded corner next to the area with a lot of vines
- glow berry: to my knowledge, you just use bone meal on the cave vines near the boat and then harvest those glow berries, but not preexisting ones. lmk if you find more "legal" ways of doing it
- pumpkin: caves of carnage: halloween house (secret button at the back of the house)
- amethyst: caves of carnage (you're allowed to break the amethyst on the budding amethyst blocks)
