# Decked Out 2 Manual Randomizer Setup Guide

Last-Updated 2024-04-30 (yyyy-mm-dd)

## Required Software

- Minecraft Java Edition from the [Minecraft Java Edition Store Page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition)
  - You don't need to have it installed, you just need to own it.
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- CurseForge from the [CurseForge Download Page](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)

## Installation Procedures

Make sure a copy of the Manual world is in the lib/world directory of your client-side installation.
You *can* do installation without CurseForge, and if you want to do it, visit [This Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/18sa8j6/how_to_play_decked_out_2/)
Otherwise, do the following:
1. Click on Minecraft on CurseForge
2. Search for the Decked Out 2 Modpack, available online [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/decked-out-expansion-pack/files/), if necessary.
3. Download it, and play it.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Launch the launcher.
2. Click on Manual client on the right.
3. At the top enter your server's ip with the port provided (by default archipelago.gg:38281).
4. In Manual Game ID put "Manual_DeckedOut2_empathymp3" then press the Connect button on the top right.
5. In the command field at the bottom enter the name of your slot you chose in your Player.yaml then press enter

## Manual Client

In the "Tracker and Locations" tab you'll find buttons corresponding with all the available locations in the Randomizer.  
Since this is a manual game its built on trustâ„¢ you press the locations when you get to them,  
hopefully in the future only what you can access will be visible but at the moment  
you could press victory and it would accept it.

## Multiplayer Manual

You can play this with other players (if you use the Decked Out 2 Modpack).
You'll need to host a fabric server, explained in [This Guide](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:server:windows).
You'll also need to install the following mods onto the server:
- [AudioPlayer](https://modrinth.com/mod/audioplayer/version/fabric-1.20.1-1.8.6)
- [Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet/version/1.4.112)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.91.0+1.20.1)
- [VoiceChat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat/version/fabric-1.20.1-2.4.32)
Also, you can install [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium/version/mc1.20.1-0.11.2) for better server optimizations.
