# Decked Out 2 Manual Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Minecraft Java Edition from the [Minecraft Java Edition Store Page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition)
  - You don't need to have it installed, you just need to own it.
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- The [Decked Out Expansion Pack 2.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/decked-out-expansion-pack/files/)
- The following mods:

  - [AudioPlayer](https://modrinth.com/mod/audioplayer/version/fabric-1.20.1-1.8.6)
  - [Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet/version/1.4.112)
  - [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.91.0+1.20.1)
  - [VoiceChat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat/version/fabric-1.20.1-2.4.32)

- It's also recommended that you use these (for better optimizations):

  - [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium/version/mc1.20.1-0.11.2) if you're doing this singleplayer
  - [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/version/mc1.20.1-0.5.3)

## Installation Procedures

Make sure a copy of the Manual world is in the lib/world directory of your client-side installation.
In the Mod Manager of your choice, install all of the mods for Fabric 1.20.1.
Drop the Decked Out Expansion Pack into your saves folder in your Minecraft install.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Launch the launcher.
2. Click on Manual client on the right.
3. At the top enter your server's ip with the port provided (by default archipelago.gg:38281).
4. In Manual Game ID put "Manual_DeckedOut2_empathymp3" then press the Connect button on the top right.
5. In the command field at the bottom enter the name of your slot you chose in your Player.yaml then press enter

## Manual Client

In the "Tracker and Locations" tab you'll find buttons corresponding with all the available locations in the Randomizer. Since this is a manual game its built on trustâ„¢ you press the locations when you get to them, hopefully in the future only what you can access will be visible but at the moment you could press victory and it would accept it.

## Multiplayer Manual

You can play this with other players (if you use the Decked Out 2 Modpack).
You'll need to host a fabric server, explained in [This Guide](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:server:windows).
You'll also need to install the following mods onto the server (mostly the same mods as earlier):

- [AudioPlayer](https://modrinth.com/mod/audioplayer/version/fabric-1.20.1-1.8.6)
- [Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet/version/1.4.112)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.91.0+1.20.1)
- [VoiceChat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat/version/fabric-1.20.1-2.4.32)
  
Also, you can install [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium/version/mc1.20.1-0.11.2) for better server optimizations.

- You'll also need to give the resources.zip file that comes with the world download to everyone who joins the server, including yourself.
- After that, go get the Dungeon Lackey item from the Dungeon Master Locker (make sure to make more copies in creative mode), and put one into where it's indicated (*before* putting in the deck).
- I recommend you also go into creative mode and put a chest with several copies of the map you get at the start.
- If you have 3 or more players, you should have a command block set up that says "/tp @p -620 50 1950" so the third and fourth etc. players can join runs.
- However, more players than 2 does make it more difficult.

## Main Game

- Launch your modded install
- Open the Decked Out Expansion Pack
- Obtain a Shulker Box (your deck), put all of the cards you've received thus far into your deck (except for Ethereal cards, which you can save for later), and put a Frozen Shard into the barrel next to the dungeon entrance. 
  - Note: The game doesn't start if you have an empty deck, and breaks if you have a deck with only Ethereal cards. If you have no cards, put a Sneak into your deck, temporarily, until you get any non-Ethereal cards.
